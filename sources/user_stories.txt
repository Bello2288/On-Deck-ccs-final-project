    On Deck is an app I am developing that is geared towards any individual that has a busy schedule
but would still love to play sports that fits their life style. I personally would have found this app 
very helpful many years ago when my wife and I were starting our family. I was pretty involved in 
playing multiple sports, but found that became more and more difficult as the kids were getting older. 
I had to give up playing to focus more time with my family.


    Due to the nature of being an adult, things just sometimes come up. An individual may find that 
they are unable to make it to a scheduled game. Now the team organizer will find themselves scrambling 
around trying to find someone to fill in so they do not have to play short handed or forfeit completely. 


    So that is where On Deck comes in. Teams will be able to make a post about their game, and be able 
to fill that empty spot with a person "on deck".
